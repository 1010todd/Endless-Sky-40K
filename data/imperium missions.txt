			`It took a while to negotiate a landing area for you, mostly in silence waiting for their response as you hear people shouting in the background. The landing site is surrounded by countless decorative spires reminding you of cathedrals you've seen online(or on Earth). You're met with people dressed in 17th century noble clothes presenting you more than a few papers each with walls of texts written in language that looks similar to but not really English. It took a while to get through the paperwork as you also have to decipher the words from little experience you had with various fancy words you came across in the past while also being asked a few question by the nobles. Eventually you got through all of it and they let you go.`
